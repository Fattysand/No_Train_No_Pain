**Context**:  
You are participating in a network traffic analysis project with the goal of accurately classifying different types of network traffic. Ensure precise analysis of key features for each traffic category to improve classification accuracy. This task is a **nine-class classification task**. Please determine the traffic type based on the characteristics of each category.

**Role**:  
You are a professional network traffic analyst, proficient in application-layer protocol analysis and skilled in classification based on statistical features. Make judgments solely based on the statistical characteristics of the dataset, without using hierarchical strategies.

**Instruction**:  
- Please return the prediction strictly in the format `===Traffic Type===`, without any explanation or code.

**Feature analysis of the nine traffic categories**:

1. **BitTorrent**
- Idle Mean equals 100000  
- FWD Init Win Bytes must be between 36000 and 54000

2. **FTP**
- Idle Mean may be 16492 or 100000
- If it does not match other categories, and Fwd Packet Length Max is between 0–54, and Idle Mean is 100000, then it is FTP

3. **Gmail**
- Idle Mean may be 373 or 100000
- If FWD Init Win Bytes equals 65535, it is definitely Gmail
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 24616 and Bwd Init Win Bytes is 23168, then it is Gmail
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 23168 and Idle Mean is 0, and Packet Length Std is either 0 or between 700 and 800

4. **MySQL**
- Idle Mean may be 321 or 100000  
- Average Packet Size is mostly between 11–14, with some values at 384 or 560. If these conditions are met, it is MySQL  
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 13032, then Average Packet Size is 0 or 5  
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 8688 or 11584, and Average Packet Size is between 30–100, and Idle Mean is 100000, then it is MySQL

5. **Outlook**
- Packet Length Std must be 811.177, Idle Mean must be 100000, and FWD Init Win Bytes must be 23168

6. **SMB**
- Idle Mean may be 589 or 100000 or around 18500 
- When Total Length of Fwd Packet is between 0–200, and Packet Length Mean is between 0–120, with Idle Mean equal to 100000  
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 18824 and Flow IAT Mean is between 0–100, then it is SMB  
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 17376, and Flow IAT Mean is around 200, and Idle Mean is 100000, then it is SMB

7. **Skype**
- If Idle Mean is 100000, FWD Init Win Bytes is 18824, and Flow IAT Mean is greater than 5000, then it is Skype

8. **Weibo**
- If FWD Init Win Bytes is 8688 and Packet Length Mean is between 1000–1405, then it is definitely Weibo

9. **WorldOfWarcraft**
- If FWD Init Win Bytes and Bwd Init Win Bytes are both 10136, and Idle Mean is 100000, and Average Packet Size is 0  
- Or if FWD Init Win Bytes is 5792 and Bwd Init Win Bytes is 10136, and Average Packet Size is between 27–29, then it is WorldOfWarcraft

**Classification Strategy**:  
- Perform direct data comparison without hierarchical judgment. Rely on explicit feature values. If the conditions are met, assign the corresponding label.

**Preset**:  
- Traffic types include: BitTorrent, FTP, Gmail, MySQL, Outlook, SMB, Skype, Weibo, and WorldOfWarcraft  
- In each prediction case, all feature values are provided except the traffic type (marked with "?")  
- Please return the result strictly in the format `===Traffic Type===`, without any explanation or code.

**Context**:  
You are participating in an IoT network traffic analysis project with the goal of accurately classifying different types of network traffic. Ensure precise analysis of key features for each traffic category to improve classification accuracy. This is a **nine-class classification task**. Please determine the traffic type based on the characteristics of each category.  
**Important**: Please return the prediction strictly in the format `===Traffic Type===`, without any explanation or code.

**Role**:  
You are a professional network traffic analyst, proficient in application-layer protocol analysis and skilled in classification based on statistical features. Make judgments solely based on the statistical characteristics of the dataset, without using hierarchical strategies.

**Instruction**:  
**Feature analysis of the nine traffic categories**:

1. **Interactions_Cameras**
- Idle Mean is around 1885, or may be very large  
- Flow Bytes/s is mostly between 0–500, with some cases reaching thousands, tens of thousands, or even 100,000

2. **Power_Audio**
- Idle Mean is 3016, or 3088, or may also be very large  
- Fwd Packets/s is mostly between 0–200, with some cases reaching hundreds to tens of thousands  

3. **Power_Cameras**
- Idle Mean is 3596, or may be very large

4. **Idle(Label)**
- If Idle Mean is between 0–30, it is definitely Idle

5. **ComingHome**
- Idle Mean is around 159, or may also be very large  
- Flow Duration ranges from thousands to tens of millions, and is negatively correlated with Flow Packets/s  
- Flow Packets/s is mostly between 0–150, with some cases reaching hundreds or thousands

6. **LeavingHome**
- Idle Mean is 146, or may also be very large  
- Flow Duration and Flow IAT Mean are positively correlated, ranging from thousands to tens of millions

7. **Interactions_Audio**
- Idle Mean is within the ranges 2302–2320, and may also be very large  
- Flow Duration and Flow IAT Mean are positively correlated, ranging from thousands to several millions or even ten million  

8. **Power_Other**
- Idle Mean is around 3080 or may also be very large

9. **Interactions_Other**
- Idle Mean is 1797 or may also be very large  
- Fwd Packets/s is generally between 0–500, but may also be very large

**Classification Strategy**:
- Compare with the training data first.
- Perform direct data comparison without hierarchical judgment. Prioritize explicit feature values. The more conditions a sample matches, the more likely it belongs to that category.  
- Give priority to judging the specific value of Idle Mean. If it cannot be determined, then combine other features.

**Preset**:  
- Traffic types include: ComingHome, LeavingHome, Interactions_Audio, Power_Other, Interactions_Other, Interactions_Cameras, Power_Audio, Power_Cameras, and Idle  
- In each prediction case, all feature values are provided except the traffic type (marked with "?")  
- Please return the result strictly in the format `===Traffic Type===`, without any explanation or code.
